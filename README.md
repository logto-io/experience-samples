## Deploy to Logto Cloud

You can build any of the individual sample projects and deploy to your Logto Cloud instance. Here is how you can do it:

1. Clone the repository
2. Go to the sample project you want to deploy. For example, `cd packages/sign-in-with-password`
3. Install node dependencies with `pnpm install` (recommended) or `npm install`.
4. Build the project with `pnpm build` (recommended) or `npm run build`. This will generate a `dist` folder with the built assets.
5. Sign in to your Logto Cloud account and create a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) application. Copy the `App ID` and `App secret` from the application settings.
6. Create a `.env` file in the sample project folder or root folder with the following content:

  ```env
  LOGTO_ENDPOINT=https://<your-tenant-id>.logto.app/
  LOGTO_AUTH=<your-app-id>:<your-app-secret>
  LOGTO_PATH=<your-workspace-path>/experience-samples/packages/sign-in-with-password/dist
  LOGTO_RESOURCE=https://<your-tenant-id>.logto.app/api
  ```
7. Run `npx logto-tunnel deploy` to deploy the sample custom experience to your Logto Cloud instance, and replace the default Logto sign-in experience. Refer to the [Logto tunnel documentation](https://docs.logto.io/docs/references/tunnel-cli/deploy/) for more details.
